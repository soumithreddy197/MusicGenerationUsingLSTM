# MusicGenerationUsingLSTM
There are many fields where Neural Networks are showing commendable grown with impeccable results matching
humans in performance. Some of them are Image Recognition, Speech recognition, speech to text conversion. In this
work I want to explore Music Generation using Character
based RNN. There are already many kinds of implementations about music generation, I want to explore one kind
of music generation which is least explored by others and
demonstrate my findings.
There are four python notebooks where each one has a variation of model which loads weights automatically and generated music.
